## 🌟 Overview

**Mishkat Al-Ahadith** ("The Niche of Lamps") is a full-featured Islamic Hadith library built with Flutter. It's more than a static book reader — it pairs a huge, well-organized corpus of authenticated hadiths with modern tools: an AI assistant grounded in trusted sources, live prayer times, a Qiblah compass, and home-screen widgets, so users can read, search, save, and act on the Sunnah every day.

<div align="center">

**📚 17 books · 📄 700+ chapters · 🕋 51,000+ hadiths · 🧠 AI-assisted reading**

</div>

### Highlights

- **Massive, curated corpus** — Sahih Al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Abu Dawood, Sunan At-Tirmidhi, Sunan An-Nasa'i, Muwatta Malik, and more, organized as Book → Chapter → Hadith.
- **Serag AI** — a Sharia-focused assistant that explains hadiths and answers questions, grounded in classical sources.
- **A native worship toolkit** — accurate prayer times, a Qiblah compass, and a Hijri calendar, backed by device-level scheduling that survives reboots.
- **Built to last offline** — Hive-backed local storage and cached content for a fast, reliable reading experience.
- **Arabic-first, RTL-native UI** — every screen is designed and tested right-to-left, not translated as an afterthought.
- **Clean, layered architecture** — Presentation → Domain → Data, with Cubit/BLoC state management and `get_it` dependency injection throughout.

## ✨ Features

### 📚 A Complete Hadith Library

Browse a huge, trustworthy hadith library organized the way scholars study it: **Books → Chapters (أبواب) → Hadiths**, plus a topical classification view (Faith, Purification, Prayer, and more) for jumping straight to a subject.

<div align="center">
<img src="screenshots/categories.png" width="850" alt="Library, chapters and classifications screens"/>
</div>

- Full book catalogue with cover art and per-book hadith counts (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Abu Dawood, Sunan At-Tirmidhi, Sunan An-Nasa'i, Muwatta Malik...)
- Chapter-by-chapter navigation for focused reading
- Subject-based classifications for quick topical access
- Every hadith carries its authenticity grade (صحيح / حسن / ضعيف) at a glance

### 🔍 Smart Filterable Search

A search engine built for scale, searching instantly across 51,000+ hadiths.

<div align="center">
<img src="screenshots/search.png" width="850" alt="Search, results and advanced filters screens"/>
</div>

- **Quick search** with recent searches and smart suggestions
- **Advanced filters** — by book, narrator, authenticity grade, topic, and chapter
- **Ranked results** showing the matched book, grade badge, and hadith number
- One-tap **bookmarking** straight from the results list

### 🌅 Daily and Random Hadith

Two lightweight habits built right into the home screen: a curated hadith every day, and a random one whenever curiosity strikes.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="screenshots/daily_hadith.png" width="100%" alt="Hadith of the day screen"/></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="screenshots/random_hadith.png" width="100%" alt="Random hadith screen"/></td>
</tr>
</table>

- **Hadith of the Day** — a hand-picked hadith with full text, explanation (شرح), word meanings, and lessons learned
- **Random Hadith** — a fresh pick on demand, sourced from the same authenticated corpus
- Copy, share, or bookmark any hadith in one tap
- One-tap **quick AI analysis** available on any hadith details screen for an instant breakdown

### 📌 Bookmarks and Custom Collections

Never lose track of a hadith that matters to you.

<div align="center">
<img src="screenshots/bookmarks.png" width="380" alt="Bookmarks and collections screens"/>
</div>

- Save any hadith with a single tap
- Organize saves into **named collections** (e.g. "Prayer hadiths", "Ramadan")
- Search inside your saved hadiths and collections
- Everything is stored locally for instant, offline access

### 🤖 Meet Serag the AI Assistant

**Serag** (سراج, Arabic for "lantern") is a Sharia-focused AI assistant built into the app: ask about a hadith or a fiqh question and get an answer grounded in trusted Islamic sources, not a generic chatbot.

<div align="center">
<img src="screenshots/serag.png" width="380" alt="Serag AI chat assistant"/>
</div>

- Conversational Q&A about hadiths, meanings, and rulings
- Answers reference their sources and follow a recognized Islamic methodology
- **Chat history** is saved so you can revisit past conversations
- Daily usage is quota-based and clearly displayed to the user
- Available 24/7, directly from the hadith details screen or its own tab

> ⚠️ Like any AI assistant, Serag can get things wrong — the app is upfront about this and always points users back to authoritative sources to confirm an answer.

### 🕌 Prayer Times and Qiblah Finder

Everyday worship tools built natively, not bolted on.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="screenshots/prayer_times.png" width="100%" alt="Prayer times screen"/></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="screenshots/qiplah.png" width="100%" alt="Qiblah compass screen"/></td>
</tr>
</table>

- Prayer times computed from the device's **live location**, using the Egyptian General Authority calculation method
- Countdown to the next prayer, plus the full day's schedule at a glance
- **Qiblah compass** with live bearing, deviation angle, and an accuracy indicator
- Combined **Hijri + Gregorian date** display throughout the app

### 📲 Home Screen Widgets

Take the app's most-used content to the home screen, no need to open the app.

<div align="center">
<img src="screenshots/home_widgets.jpeg" width="380" alt="Android home screen widgets"/>
</div>

- **Hadith of the Day** widget, refreshed automatically in the background
- **Prayer Times** widget with today's full schedule
- Kept in sync via a background worker, independent of whether the app is open

### 🔔 Native Notifications

Notifications engineered at the platform level, not left to default plugin behavior.

<div align="center">
<img src="screenshots/feature_collection_2.png" width="480" alt="Notifications, widgets and native integrations overview"/>
</div>

- **Exact prayer-time alarms** scheduled through Android's `AlarmManager`, delivered even while the device is idle
- Survives **reboots and timezone changes** via a native boot receiver that automatically re-schedules every alarm
- Daily hadith reminders and configurable per-prayer alerts
- Backed by Firebase Cloud Messaging for remote and push notifications

### 🔐 Authentication

A simple, privacy-respecting sign-in flow.

<div align="center">
<img src="screenshots/auth.png" width="380" alt="Login and sign-up screens"/>
</div>

- Email & password, backed by Firebase Authentication
- **Google Sign-In**
- **Guest mode** — browse the entire library without creating an account
- Clear consent to terms and privacy policy at sign-up

## 🧩 Architecture

The app follows a **feature-first Clean Architecture**: every feature under `lib/features/<feature_name>/` is split into its own layers.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                PRESENTATION                  │
│    Screens · Widgets · Cubits (BLoC)         │
└───────────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                         │ depends on
┌───────────────────────▼───────────────────────┐
│                   DOMAIN                      │
│   Use Cases · Entities · Business Rules       │
│           (zero Flutter imports)              │
└───────────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                         │ depends on
┌───────────────────────▼───────────────────────┐
│                    DATA                       │
│  Repositories · Data Sources · Models         │
│     (Dio/Retrofit APIs, Hive, preferences)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **State management** — `flutter_bloc` / Cubit; Cubits depend only on use cases, never on repositories or data sources directly.
- **Dependency injection** — `get_it`, registered centrally under `lib/core/di/`.
- **Routing** — centralized route names and a single app router, no ad-hoc navigation.
- **Error handling** — exceptions are caught and mapped to typed `Failure`s in the data layer; the domain layer returns a result type; the presentation layer turns failures into user-friendly states.
- **RTL by design** — directional widgets (`EdgeInsetsDirectional`, `AlignmentDirectional`) are used throughout since the app is Arabic-first.

---

## 🎨 Design System

An Islamic-inspired visual identity, defined centrally in `lib/core/theming/`:

```dart
primaryPurple    = #7440E9   // Primary brand color
primaryGold      = #FFB300   // Islamic gold accents
secondaryPurple  = #9D7BF0   // Supporting purple tones
```

- **Typography** — Amiri for Arabic hadith text, Cairo and YaModernPro for UI text
- **Responsive sizing** — `flutter_screenutil` for adaptive layouts across devices
- **Consistent components** — card-based layouts, soft gradients, and subtle Islamic geometric motifs
